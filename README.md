# robot-appium-app-browserstack

This repository demonstrates how to run Appium Python tests on BrowserStack App Automate.

## Based on

These code samples are currently based on:

- **Appium-Python-Client:** `3.2.1`
- **Selenium:** `4.16.0`
- **Protocol:** `W3C`

## Setup

### Requirements

1. Python 3.7+

   > **_NOTE:_** Since v1.0.0, only Python 3.7+ is supported.

   - For Windows, download latest python version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and run the installer executable
   - For Mac and Linux, run `python --version` to see what python version is pre-installed. If you want a different version download from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Package Manager pip

   Note : `pip` comes installed with python 3.4+

   - If `pip` is not installed, follow these instructions:

     - Securely download get-pip.py by following this link: [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) or use following cURL command to download it:

     ```sh
     curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
     ```

     - After dowloading, run the file :

       - For Python 3

         ```sh
         python3 get-pip.py
         ```

### Install the dependencies

To install the dependencies, run the following command in project's base directory:

- For Python 3

  ```sh
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Getting Started

Getting Started with Appium tests in Robot on BrowserStack couldn't be easier!

### **Run your first test :**
Open `Android` or `iOS` folder :

- If you have uploaded your app then add the app id to the `browserstack.yml` config file, or you can directly specify the path to your app in the `browserstack.yml` file.

- Run `browserstack-sdk robot SingleTestAndroid.robot`

- You can access the test execution results, and debugging information such as video recording, network logs on [App Automate dashboard](https://app-automate.browserstack.com/dashboard)

---

### **Use Local testing for apps that access resources hosted in development or testing environments :**

Open `Android` or `iOS` folder :

- Ensure that `browserstackLocal` capability is set to `true` in the `browserstack.yml` file

- If you have uploaded your app then add the app id to the `browserstack.yml` config file, or you can directly specify the path to your app in the `browserstack.yml` file.

- Run `browserstack-sdk robot LocalTestAndroid.robot`

- You can access the test execution results, and debugging information such as video recording, network logs on [App Automate dashboard](https://app-automate.browserstack.com/dashboard)
